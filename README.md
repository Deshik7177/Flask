# Flask Roadmap

## üå± Phase 1: Baby Steps ‚Äî Flask Basics

**Goal:** Understand what Flask is and build a basic app.

- Learn Python (functions, classes, decorators)
- Understand Flask: WSGI, micro-framework, routing
- Use `@app.route()` to handle URLs
- Learn Jinja2 templating (`{{ }}`, `{% %}`)
- Handle GET/P OST requests with `request`
- Serve static files (images, CSS, JS)
- Use `render_template`, `redirect`, and `url_for`

**Mini Project:**
- To-Do App with task add/delete and UI using Bootstrap

---

## üöÄ Phase 2: Level Up ‚Äî Flask with Real Data

**Goal:** Work with databases and persistent storage.

- Use Flask-SQLAlchemy (ORM)
- Integrate SQLite or PostgreSQL
- Perform CRUD operations
- Use Flask-WTF for form handling + validation
- Build custom forms and use `flash` messages

**Mini Project:**
- Blog App with user posts, edit/delete, and comments

---

## üîê Phase 3: Real World ‚Äî Authentication & Blueprints

**Goal:** Add user auth and make your app modular.

- Use Flask-Login for user sessions
- Secure passwords with `werkzeug.security`
- Use Flask Blueprints for modular code structure
- Implement login/logout, session management
- Add custom error pages (404, 500)

**Mini Project:**
- Personal Diary App where each user has private notes

---

## üì° Phase 4: Flask as an API Beast

**Goal:** Use Flask to build REST APIs for frontend/mobile apps.

- Understand REST fundamentals (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Build APIs using Flask-RESTful or API Blueprint
- Send JSON responses using `jsonify()`
- Accept JSON via `request.get_json()`
- Test using Postman/Insomnia
- Add pagination and filtering

**Mini Project:**
- Notes API with full CRUD and auth via tokens

---

## üß™ Phase 5: Testing, Debugging & Logs

**Goal:** Improve reliability with tests and logs.

- Learn `unittest` and `pytest` basics
- Use Flask‚Äôs test client for simulating requests
- Add logging with Python `logging` module
- Track and display errors cleanly

**Mini Project:**
- Add unit tests and error logs to Blog/Notes app

---

## üì¶ Phase 6: Advanced Flask ‚Äî Background Tasks & File Handling

**Goal:** Make Flask production-ready with async tasks and file features.

- Upload and download files via `request.files`
- Send emails using Flask-Mail or SMTP
- Use Celery with Redis for background tasks
- Schedule tasks using APScheduler

**Mini Project:**
- File-sharing app with email notifications + background upload tracking

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Phase 7: Docker, Deployment & CI/CD

**Goal:** Make your Flask app cloud-ready and automatable.

- Dockerize Flask apps (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`)
- Use Gunicorn + Nginx for production
- Deploy to:
  - Heroku.
  - Render
  - Railway
  - AWS/VPS
- Setup CI/CD using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI

**Mini Project:**
- Deploy your Blog/API app with Docker + GitHub CI/CD
